## 🛠️ About

This is an old project I’m revisiting and fixing.

The codebase is currently under refactor, so you’ll find a mix of old decisions and newer, cleaner implementations. The goal here is improvement — not perfection.

If something looks odd, chances are it’s either:

- legacy code
- in the middle of being refactored
- or something I’ve learned not to do anymore 🙂
